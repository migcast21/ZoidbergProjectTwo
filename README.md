Project Two was completed using MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, and EJS.

The basis for this project was a fully functional CRUD app, utilizing a schema for coffee drinks that allows the user to edit, delete, or create their own entry of a coffee beverage recipe. The website is fairly simple, with an emphasis on minimalist design and clean functionality. Achievements include successfully implementing a mobile version, the site looks more accessible when viewed on smaller screens and adapts to fit those formats, a stark contrast from my unit 1 project.

In terms of unsolved problems, the app ended up fully functional so there was nothing left unsolved. In terms of eventual aspirations, I did want to set up some sort of rating system like in GoodReads, Untappd, or Letterboxd that lets the user rate each individual style of drink to their liking. Further ideas included implementing a login system that would store each user's ratings, and more.

Overall, I am satisfied with the outcome, a simple app that lets users contribute to the existing array of data, in palatable fashion.
